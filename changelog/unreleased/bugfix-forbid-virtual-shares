Bugfix: Prevent "virtual" spaces from being displayed in the UI

While ownCloud Web is capable of displaying any type of spaces we found out that it is not valid to display so called "virtual" spaces. In such a case users now get redirected to their default location (personal space for users, project spaces overview  for guests).
