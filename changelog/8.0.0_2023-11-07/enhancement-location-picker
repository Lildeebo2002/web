Enhancement: Location picker in embed mode

We've added a new query param called `embed-target` which can have value `location`. This value is then saved in the `configuration.options` object as `embedTarget`.
When the value is set to `location`, it allows selecting the `currentFolder` as location instead of selecting resources.
